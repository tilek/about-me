DRAFT
* This document is a quick draft, please avoid expecting completeness and deeply-thought-out revisions.
* I welcome you to provide feedback to improve this document.
<br>

This document is meant to include only weaknesses.
I differentiate weaknesses and areas for development this way:

* Weaknesses: something that strikes people as lower than average in their group
* Areas for development: areas I think are most important to improve in
<br>
LEVEL 1. More severe weaknesses. ðŸ¤£
<br>
<br>
Individual:

* Reading: reading attention, speed, and volume [trying to address by reading more]
* Memory: losing and forgetting physical objects (passport, hearing aid, water bottle) [trying to address it by scanning the place before leaving it]
* Rational actions & avoidance: delaying getting reimbursements (e.g. from health insurance) [trying to address by asking other people to help]
<br>
<br>
Social:

* English language: some grammar, some pronunciation, some punctuation [not addressing at the moment]
<br>
<br>
<br>
LEVEL 2. Less severe weaknesses. ðŸ™„
<br>
<br>
Individual:

* Memory: forgetting some verbal promises of medium significance [trying to address it by writing down promises, checking my calendar for meeting agreements in advance]
* Sense of time: losing track of time [trying to address this by extensively using digital reminders and alarms]
<br>
<br>
Social:

* Overall: struggling to balance between speaking very positively about my achievements and being too self-boasting
* Face-to-face conversations: can be thinking deeply about something and miss when a person is trying to talk to me
* Face-to-face conversations: unconsciously pivoting certain % of discussion topics to myself or topics that mainly interest me
* Face-to-face conversations: interrupting other people without noticing
* Face-to-face conversations: sometimes not noticing when people lose interest in my story
* Face-to-face conversations: struggling to tell compelling stories
* Digital communication: sometimes emailing people asking a question and not replying or replying too late
