I differentiate weaknesses and areas for development this way:
1. Weaknesses: something that strikes people as lower than average in their group
2. Areas for development: areas I think are most important to improve in

This document is meant to include only #1.

Levels below are sorted from most severe to least severe:
<br>
<br>
<br>
LEVEL 1. 🤣
<br>
<br>
Individual:

* Reading: reading attention, speed, and volume [for now addressing by listening to audiobooks, watching videos, reading summaries, being surrounded by people who read those books]
* Memory: losing and forgetting physical objects (passport, hearing aid, water bottle) [trying to address it by scanning the place before leaving it]
* Rational actions: delaying getting reimbursements (e.g. from health insurance)
<br>
<br>
Social:
- English language: some grammar, some pronunciation, some punctuation
<br>
<br>
<br>
LEVEL 2. 🙄
<br>
<br>
Individual:

* Memory: losing and forgetting some verbal promises of medium significance [trying to address it by writing down promises, checking my calendar for meeting agreements in advance]
* Sense of time: losing track of time trying to address this by extensively using digital reminders and alarms]
* Rational actions: sometimes wasting more than an hour on YouTube when I am tired [trying to address it by running and going to sleep]
<br>
<br>
Social:

* Overall: struggling to balance between speaking very positively about my achievements and being too self-boasting
* Face-to-face conversations: can be thinking deeply about something and miss when a person is trying to talk to me
* Face-to-face conversations: unconsciously pivoting certain % of discussion topics to myself or topics that mainly interest me
* Face-to-face conversations: interrupting other people without noticing
* Digital communication: sometimes emailing people asking a question and not replying or replying too late
* Storytelling: telling compelling stories
