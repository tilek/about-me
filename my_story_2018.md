I grew up in Kyrgyzstan where my first dream job was to become a math teacher until I first encountered a computer. It was an 8-bit Soviet computer called Korvet (Корвет). Quite soon I realized that you can do all sorts of fun pranks with it, as well as math too! My mom later told me that it could also be a good career path (what luck!), so decided to definitely study software engineering and applied to American University in Central Asia. 5 amazing years later literally unbelievably for me Google recruiters reached out to me based on my resume on Monster.com and after my two attempts I found myself at Google on [The Emerald Isle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland).

After several years of great [craic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craic) in Ireland I then had a quick fun stint in Switzerland before finally moving to San Francisco.

Now I work for a company that is called X. Yes, just X. :) It used to be called Google[x] until 2015 when it became one of Google's sister companies in a new family called Alphabet. X is an incubator that aims to launch "moonshots" - projects with ambitious goals around technology and positive impact on the society. [Graduates of X](https://x.company/projects/) include self-driving car company Waymo, life sciences company Verily, and machine learning infrastructure Google Brain.

At X I am a project lead focused on mapping global connectivity, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and the planet in general.
